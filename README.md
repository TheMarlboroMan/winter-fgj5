# winter-fgj5

This project depends on https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/libdansdl2 and https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/herramientas_proyecto. 

Be sure to compile them and to update the "makefile_linux" file with the correct routes.

As of nov 5th 2015, the code has been patched to require the compatibility layer in the repository "capa_compatibilidad_libdansdl2" and to link with SDL2_tff (even though it is not used). Should the code be updated the compatibility layer will be removed.
